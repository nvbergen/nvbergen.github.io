I’ve always believed that the first step is often the hardest, but it’s also the most important. So, here I am, taking that first step and inviting you to join me on this journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-this-blog-exists\"\u003eWhy This Blog Exists\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to create this blog, professional portfolio, and website for two main reasons. First, I\u0026rsquo;m entering a new job search, and this space will serve as a dynamic showcase of my skills, projects, and professional experiences. But more importantly, I want this platform to be a place where I can share my thoughts, ideas, and learnings, especially with those who, like me, are navigating the world of data engineering, data science, and technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"a-bit-about-me\"\u003eA Bit About Me\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor more than a decade, I worked in financial services, building a solid foundation in the industry. However, after many years, I felt the urge to try something different, leading to a sabbatical where I ventured into the commercial aviation sector. It was a bold move, but it was also a reminder of how much I enjoy tackling new challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne constant throughout my career has been my love for data—the way it can be “sliced and diced” to uncover insights and drive decisions. That passion led me to take a risk and enroll in a Data Science bootcamp. I’ll be honest; I wasn’t fully prepared for the steep learning curve that practitioners of data science face. But I stuck with it, pushed through, and successfully completed the program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmed with new skills, I returned to the job market and found myself pivoting once again. This time, I joined Vanguard, where I worked in data management, helping to establish and improve their metadata management and governance practices. It was a role that allowed me to combine my background in financial services with my newfound data skills, and it was incredibly rewarding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-im-writing\"\u003eWhy I’m Writing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve always enjoyed writing, whether it’s to communicate ideas, share stories, or document my thoughts. Through this blog, I want to do just that—share what I’ve learned and continue learning. But it’s not just about writing; it’s about “learning in public.” I’ll be publishing blog posts, notes, and hands-on projects that showcase my ongoing journey in data science and engineering. You’ll also find links to my GitHub repositories where you can dive deeper into the code and projects I’m working on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those who are just getting started in tech, or for seasoned professionals, I hope my insights and experiences will be useful. For recruiters, this site is designed to give you a clear picture of who I am, what I can do, and what I aspire to achieve in this industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"whats-next\"\u003eWhat’s Next?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI’m excited to share more in the coming weeks—articles, projects, and insights from my career. There’s a lot to cover, and I’m just getting started. So, whether you’re here out of curiosity, to connect, or to see what I’m up to, I’m glad you’ve found your way to this little corner of the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you for being here, and I hope you’ll stick around for the journey ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil next time, Nick\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"The first step is often the hardest.
