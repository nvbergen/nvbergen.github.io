My results demonstrate that being vulnerable and objective can provide key insights that are essential for ongoing learning and lead to overall progress vs trying to be a data expert in everything data. Conducting regular retrospectives on my progress by attempting a quantitative and qualitative analytical approach.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"reminding-myself-that-consistent-progress-is-better-than-perfection\"\u003eReminding myself that consistent progress is better than perfection\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA lot of us have this notion that the path to achieving anything is mostly linear.  \u003cem\u003eDo task X, result is Y.\u003c/em\u003e Rinse, lather, and repeat until you\u0026rsquo;re \u0026ldquo;successful\u0026rdquo;. The hard reality is that for nearly all of us, myself included, \u0026ldquo;the path\u0026rdquo; is neither straight nor directionally forward or even at times visible. It is this fact that is the most difficult for me right at this moment because it requires a great deal of self-reflection and seeing the true \u003cem\u003ecurrent state\u003c/em\u003e of my skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis post aims to share my self-assessment journey in analytical and technical skills.  Going through this process is in the spirit of Learning in Public which is, in my opinion, essential for growth.  Honestly, this was a very hard blog post to write. Self-assessments can be scary because at the core of any self-assessment are some objective facts wrapped up in vulnerability and, eek, insecurity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"the-realization\"\u003eThe realization\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI spent the last couple of months applying for data analyst roles of any kind. I have been fortunate that most of the roles which I have interviewed for were from recruiters who approached me first. This was unlike my prior job search which was only applying as a direct hire. Luckily, in nearly all of these interviews I was able to get to the final or penultimate rounds. Obviously, none were meant to be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn rejection after rejection I either received the feedback that hiring organization \u0026ldquo;needed someone with more experience with SQL, Tableau, Master Financial Data, Alteryx, Pandas \u0026hellip; buzzy ___  skill.\u0026rdquo;,  or, I simply received no feedback at all. This is not uncommon for any job seeker and I am not indicating that my experience is any different or special. My point is that I was failing to get hired for a number of skill gaps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI would be lying if I said that a rejection still doesn\u0026rsquo;t sting. It does. What is different today versus my last job search, is that I am not taking it personally or beating myself up. There\u0026rsquo;s data in the rejection. Often it is rejection data that is more valuable than a simple successful trial.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"not-a-question-of-_why_\"\u003eNot a question of \u003cem\u003ewhy?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of my inquisitiveness, I began to ask questions. I started by taking a deep look at what I want and then working backwards from there. The key here was to stop worrying about the micro attribute of  \u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo;, but to broaden out to \u0026ldquo;How?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Who?\u0026rdquo;. That is, instead of asking \u0026ldquo;Why did I fail to get this role at this employer?\u0026rdquo;, I began to ask \u0026ldquo;\u003cem\u003eHow\u003c/em\u003e could I better meet their needs and also \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e can I demonstrate technical and non-technical skills that make me a great colleague.\u0026rdquo; and Lastly \u0026ldquo;\u003cem\u003eWho\u003c/em\u003e can I learn from to achieve my goal?\u0026rdquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the data that I had, the data was clearly telling me to upgrade very specific technical skills to take care of the \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e questions. That is great! Now I have something to do.  However, that was going to cost me time that would otherwise be spent finding potential roles and taking more interviews. The opportunity cost seemed to be pretty high so I thought that the answer to \u0026ldquo;Who\u0026rdquo; should be highly leverageable and provide more than just content and information. That\u0026rsquo;s how I ended up at Coursera!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCoursera offers a TON of options when looking to gain or re-learn technical skills. My current job search effort was clearly indicating that I should learn skills in data visualization tools (like Tableau), and get much much better at data access and manipulation tools (especially SQL). I found a solid course offered by Google and signed up!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe next challenge is that again, it was going to take time. Was there a quick fix? My job search/ rejection data is also showing that a candidate needs to be at an advanced level in more areas than I was expecting for a junior-level role. Was this my naivet√©  or ignorance of the demands of the job market?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe could debate if this is a result of GenAI disrupting nearly everything but that is a topic for another post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am not interested in passing an interview only to fail at the job. I want to learn new information. I want to apply concepts to challenges I have never seen before. In other words, I want to turn my newly gained information into knowledge!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo achieve this goal I need to let go of perfectionism, start gathering more relevant objective data and apply an introspective process to assess (and then reassess) my current state. This demanded the implementation of some analysis and some public retrospectives to help me stay on track. My analytical weapon of choice came from all of the years working in corporate jobs; the self-assessment! But how could I judge my progress? I needed a rating system to use so I could deploy my retrospectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"using-a-rating-system\"\u003eUsing a rating system\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike many of us in the corporate realm, we are all too familiar with the annual review process. On reflection, I decided to implement a similar system to help me stay on track with my learning goals and (fingers crossed) career outcomes. To do so, I chose a rating scale (1-5) used in the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition\"\u003eDreyfus model of skill acquisition\u003c/a\u003e because it provides a clear and tangible system of incremental growth.

Then, a rating for each skill will be documented before the course is taken and again after the course is completed. I hope that the before-and-after approach should provide the key insight I need to proceed confidently into future interviews and work environments! Not only that, I actually feel like I can manage myself in my activities that relate directly to getting the role that I want.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"progress-and-consistency\"\u003eProgress and consistency.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Google program has 8 courses! Each course has modules and each module has various subsections and activities. In order for my learning to be meaningful and given the speed at which I will be going through the material, it is critical for me to stay on-target with my specific goals. This requires consistent, daily, progress. If I worry about each day being perfect, well I think eventually I would just quit the project all together. I mean, why wait for all the traffic lights to be green to begin a road trip? So, I began.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"the-first-inflection-point-are-you-a-beginner\"\u003eThe first inflection point: are you a beginner?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the outset of the course, Google wanted to make sure that the learning sequence was a good fit for learners to continue forward. To do so, the course authors presented a questionnaire covering some of the core skills that a more person in a non-junior role might have. That is, if you could answer \u0026ldquo;yes\u0026rdquo; to all of their questions, you would be better served in a more advanced curriculum.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe questionnaire had 11 questions. I ended that learning session with a sobering realization that, despite my ego telling me otherwise, I am a beginner. Though, I knew this from my experience in the job market to date.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"fighting-old-demons-named-ego-and-pride\"\u003eFighting old demons named Ego and Pride\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was at odds with the results of the questionnaire but also knew that it was the right move to stay in the beginner track. My ego like the cartoon devil sitting on my shoulder, and was constantly reminding me of my past successes and achievements in the data field. Instead of an angel on my other shoulder, another devil, personal pride, also whispering that everything I have done already is important.  I needed time to acknowledge both devil characters. After all, I worked hard through each of my career incarnations. I needed to remind myself of what my current goals were: acquire new skills and RETAIN and use the knowledge. Not only that, I felt that having a public learning project would be fun. After the period of introspection, the power of the negative thoughts brought on by Ego and Pride lessened and lessened. I was able to move forward feeling good that I am not devaluing my self-worth in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDemons vanquished, the next challenge for me is to stay out of trying to learn everything perfectly and instead trust the process as a holistic journey. That is the hardest part because to me it seems like a risk. It\u0026rsquo;s risky to know \u0026ldquo;just enough\u0026rdquo; when my goal is to attain mastery. Upon reflection, I decided to stay in the beginner level course because I want a solid foundation of skills. Not perfect skills but solid. I should trust the process.

I‚Äôve always believed that the first step is often the hardest, but it‚Äôs also the most important. So, here I am, taking that first step and inviting you to join me on this journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-this-blog-exists\"\u003eWhy This Blog Exists\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to create this blog, professional portfolio, and website for two main reasons. First, I\u0026rsquo;m entering a new job search, and this space will serve as a dynamic showcase of my skills, projects, and professional experiences. But more importantly, I want this platform to be a place where I can share my thoughts, ideas, and learnings, especially with those who, like me, are navigating the world of data engineering, data science, and technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"a-bit-about-me\"\u003eA Bit About Me\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor more than a decade, I worked in financial services, building a solid foundation in the industry. However, after many years, I felt the urge to try something different, leading to a sabbatical where I ventured into the commercial aviation sector. It was a bold move, but it was also a reminder of how much I enjoy tackling new challenges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne constant throughout my career has been my love for data‚Äîthe way it can be ‚Äúsliced and diced‚Äù to uncover insights and drive decisions. That passion led me to take a risk and enroll in a Data Science bootcamp. I‚Äôll be honest; I wasn‚Äôt fully prepared for the steep learning curve that practitioners of data science face. But I stuck with it, pushed through, and successfully completed the program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmed with new skills, I returned to the job market and found myself pivoting once again. This time, I joined Vanguard, where I worked in data management, helping to establish and improve their metadata management and governance practices. It was a role that allowed me to combine my background in financial services with my newfound data skills, and it was incredibly rewarding.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"why-im-writing\"\u003eWhy I‚Äôm Writing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI‚Äôve always enjoyed writing, whether it‚Äôs to communicate ideas, share stories, or document my thoughts. Through this blog, I want to do just that‚Äîshare what I‚Äôve learned and continue learning. But it‚Äôs not just about writing; it‚Äôs about ‚Äúlearning in public.‚Äù I‚Äôll be publishing blog posts, notes, and hands-on projects that showcase my ongoing journey in data science and engineering. You‚Äôll also find links to my GitHub repositories where you can dive deeper into the code and projects I‚Äôm working on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor those who are just getting started in tech, or for seasoned professionals, I hope my insights and experiences will be useful. For recruiters, this site is designed to give you a clear picture of who I am, what I can do, and what I aspire to achieve in this industry.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"whats-next\"\u003eWhat‚Äôs Next?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI‚Äôm excited to share more in the coming weeks‚Äîarticles, projects, and insights from my career. There‚Äôs a lot to cover, and I‚Äôm just getting started. So, whether you‚Äôre here out of curiosity, to connect, or to see what I‚Äôm up to, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôve found your way to this little corner of the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThank you for being here, and I hope you‚Äôll stick around for the journey ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUntil next time, Nick\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":"The first step is often the hardest.
